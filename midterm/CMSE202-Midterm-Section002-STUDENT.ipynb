    "\n",
    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is set up so that even if you get stuck on one part there are opportunities to get points on the other parts, so consider jumping ahead if you feel like you aren't making progress and then come back later if you have time. If you have any questions during the exam, you may ask the instructor, the TA, or the LA privately: simply raise your hand and one of us will come over to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Permitted Resources:**\n",
    "You may use files stored locally on your own computer or on the JupyterHub server in engineering (https://jupyterhub.egr.msu.edu/). This includes any Jupyter Notebook files, code samples, or study materials that you personally created while preparing for this exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prohibited Resources:**\n",
    "In accordance with the course’s Generative AI Policy, this is a closed-internet exam. You are not permitted to access any online or cloud-based resources during the exam . This restriction includes (but is not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web searches (e.g., Google, Bing)\n",
    "- Generative AI tools or coding assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot)\n",
    "- Online forums or documentation (e.g., Stack Overflow)\n",
    "- Any other websites or shared repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing any of these resources or using an internet-enabled coding tool during the exam will result in a score of zero.   The only online interaction you are allowed is with your own github.com repositories, specific documentation links supplied directly in the exam, and through commandline downloading of needed files and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication Restrictions:**\n",
    "All person-to-person communication tools and collaboration platforms are strictly prohibited. You may not access:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Email or chat software (e.g., Slack, Discord, Teams)\n",
    "- Shared storage or editing tools (e.g., Google Drive, Google Docs, OneDrive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any attempt to communicate or share information during the exam will be treated as a violation of academic integrity and may also result in a score of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic Integrity Reminder:**\n",
    "Please keep your focus on your own screen. Due to limited space, students may be seated close together—so it is essential to maintain exam integrity. You must also keep your screen brightness high enough for instructors to clearly see your activity during the exam. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your individual skills and understanding. Any suspicious or inappropriate behavior observed by the instructors may result in a disciplinary action and a zero on the exam."
