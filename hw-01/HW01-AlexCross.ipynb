    "You're working as part of a new data science team and your team has been tasked with creating a Python class that can run some simple data analysis on one or more datasets that are provided to it. The hope is that this new class will make it easier for folks who are new to the team to do some basic exploratory data analysis when presented with new project data. \n",

    "Your team leader figured that this was a good opportunity to try using one of the new generative AI tools that are out there to help with the initial development of this new class. Your team leader used [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to generate the starting point for this class, using the following prompt:\n",

    "> Can you provide an example of a python class that would be useful for someone working in a computational modeling and data analysis context?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this is a pretty vague prompt. Regardless, your team now has a basic starting point to work from and your team leader wants to move forward with this idea. He has provided you with the following code that was generated by Claude. **Review the code and try running it. Make sure you understand what this code is doing.**"

Specifically, since you already spent some time getting familiar with the earthquake data in Part 3 of this assignment, let's see if your new class produces results that makes sense based on your previous observations.\n",

Make sure you don't use just the Michigan data or Indiana data that you looked at previously)\n",
